# Nawy Decisions

Short log. Add an entry for any new dependency, provider, storage change, stack change or exception to the skills.

Format: `ID — title`, then status, date, decision, reason, rejected alternatives.

## 001 — Local-first, provider-independent core

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-10-01
- Decision: Nawy must work primarily without depending on any provider or service that could cut off. External services are adapters behind interfaces.
- Reason: product direction set by the owner; protects users and the code from provider changes.
- Rejected: building Core around a single cloud or SaaS.

## 002 — Dexie/IndexedDB behind a storage interface

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-10-01
- Decision: Storage already moved from localStorage to IndexedDB via Dexie. Keep it, and put it behind a storage interface with versioned migrations.
- Reason: reliable local storage; the interface keeps Dexie replaceable.
- Rejected: localStorage for meaningful data.

## 003 — TypeScript/Vite/React as the direction for new code

- Status: proposed
- Date: 2026-10-01
- Decision: New code targets TypeScript + Vite + React. The existing vanilla PWA is migrated incrementally (data layer first, then build tooling, then screens one by one, service worker last), never rewritten in one step.
- Reason: type safety and maintainability, without risking the working app.
- Rejected: full rewrite; Next.js for this local-first app.

## 004 — Backups through a provider interface

- Status: proposed
- Date: 2026-10-01
- Decision: Google Drive backup is a provider adapter. Local JSON export/import is the baseline and never depends on a provider.
- Reason: Drive access can change or be cut off.

## 005 — Automatic reminders, push postponed

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-10-01
- Decision: Reminders are automatic at platform-appropriate times, with no user-set time. Server push backend stays postponed until a simple serverless, no-cost option exists.
- Reason: earlier product decision by the owner.

## 006 — Data core extracted to nawy-data.js (migration step 1)

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-10-01
- Decision: Dexie schema (v1, v2), default settings, normalize/sanitize/merge and the export format live in `nawy-data.js`, shared by the page and the service worker. `index.html` keeps its function names as thin wrappers. Export now carries `app`, `version` (legacy, 2) and `schemaVersion`; files with a newer version are refused. A test freezes v1 and v2 of the schema.
- Reason: the service worker previously declared its own copy of the schema (v1 only), which could diverge from the app's v2; pure functions are testable in Node.
- Rejected: moving the Dexie read/write functions in the same step (they depend on page globals and snapshots; next step).
- Side effect: service worker cache name bumped to `nawy-runtime-v1.8.0` so the new precache entry takes effect.
